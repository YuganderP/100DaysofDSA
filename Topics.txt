Day 1 
Basics of cpp
----------------------
Datatypes, strings, loops, functions,
conditionals, pass by value, pass by reference 
-----------------------
Time and Space complexity
--------
Time complexity : The rate at which time taken increases with input size 
O(big o) -> big O notation
Always compute the time complexity in worst case scenario
Avoid constants
Avoid lowervalues

Big O -> Upperbound
Theata -> Average complexity
Omega-> Lowest Bound (best case)

Space complexity: 
----------
Big O notaion is used here 
Auxilary space + input space 

Auxilary space ( the space we take to solve the problem)
input space ( the space we take to store the input problem )

-----------------------
Steps to solve pattern questions: 
most of the patterns has nested loops 

outer loop : for the rows 
inner loop : for the elements 

Rules:
1. For outter loop, count the number of rows 
2. For the inner loop focus on the columns and connect it somehow to the rows.
3. Print in the inside the inner for loop
4. (Optional) look for the symmetry
