Day 1 
Basics of cpp
----------------------
Datatypes, strings, loops, functions,
conditionals, pass by value, pass by reference 
-----------------------
Time and Space complexity
--------
Time complexity : The rate at which time taken increases with input size 
O(big o) -> big O notation
Always compute the time complexity in worst case scenario
Avoid constants
Avoid lowervalues

Big O -> Upperbound
Theata -> Average complexity
Omega-> Lowest Bound (best case)

Space complexity: 
----------
Big O notaion is used here 
Auxilary space + input space 

Auxilary space ( the space we take to solve the problem)
input space ( the space we take to store the input problem )
